## Xbot – Automated Content Posting System

Xbot is a Python-based automation system that posts scheduled tweets,
creates threads, and performs reply-based engagement using the X API v2.

Current Goal is to do this daily:
1. Retweet what I posted on my main account for maximizing user engagement(2 posts per day)
2. Analyse GitHub for trending projects and tweet about them
3. Give a developer coding related tip related to any lang/concept
4. Give project ideas to developers
