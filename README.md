## Carax1s – Automated Content Posting System

Carax1s is a Python-based automation system that posts scheduled tweets, engaging polls, tech questions, curated insights,
creates threads, and performs reply-based engagement using the X API v2.
The bot focuses on ethical automation, engagement optimization, and API-safe scheduling.

Current Goal is to do this daily:
1. Retweet what I posted on my main account for maximizing user engagement(2 posts per day)
2. Analyse GitHub for trending projects and tweet about them
3. Give a developer coding related tip related to any lang/concept
4. Give project ideas to developers
5. Conduct poles
